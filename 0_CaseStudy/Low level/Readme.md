# REFRIGERATOR


## Microcontroller

Microcontrollers are used in different components of Refrigerator.
They are User Interface,AC/DC Power supply,sensors,Temperature sensor,Motor driver,Driver etc..

## User Interface

user interface is the point of human-computer interaction and communication on a device, webpage, or app.It includes LCD,AUDIO,TOUCH BUTTONS,SLIDER ETC.

## AC/DC Power supply

 The main job of an AC/DC power supply is to transform the alternating current (AC) into a stable direct current (DC) voltage, which can then be used to power different electrical devices. Alternating current is used to transport electric power all across the electric grid, from generators to end users.
 
 
 ## Temperature Sensor
 
 The temperature sensor senses the temperature inside the refrigerator and sends information to the electronic control. Unplug the refrigerator and safely store any food that could deteriorate while the power is off before installing this part.
 
 
 ## Sensors
 
 sensor is an electronic device that can transform energy from one form to another form. So, it is also called a Transducer. The main function of the sensor is to identify and communicate with physical quantities such as temperature, heat, pressure, distance, moisture, gas, and so on. Here we used the sensor for to open /close the door. in this time when door is opened the light will glow automatically.
 
 ## Motor driver
 
 These drivers can be used to control almost any size N-channel MOSFET in a broad range of applications. Our 3-phase brushless motor drivers and brushed DC gate drivers combine a power supply and a microcontroller to create cost-efficient motor driver SBCs.This place the driver used for fan/ice machines.
 
 ## Driver
 
 This driver will help in deep fridge . when ice is stored in large porition, if you activate these driver button it helps to remove the ice where it defrozen the fridge.
