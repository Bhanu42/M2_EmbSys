# WASHING MACHINE

## Micro controller

Microcontroller reads the speed of the motor and appropriately controls the speed of the motor in different phases of washing using PWM output.They are different MCU present in a washing machine which plays a different role for User interface,Motor control,System management.

## User interface

User inference board is the human interface between the user and washing machine. This board reads the user's input and shows the status of the washing machine with LED lights.
where the microcontroller connected with different components. They are LED/LCD sensors,proximity Touch,bus buffer,level transistor.

### LED/LCD Sensor


These LED/LCD will help the people to understand how much time required to complete the washing of clothes.

### Proximity touch

A proximity sensor verifies that the door is closed and latched before start-up. For imbalance detection in washing machines, TE Connectivity provides vibration sensing with piezoelectric film technology. Its piezo film sensors are also used for control buttons in small appliance applications.


###  Level transistor

level translators are the ideal solution for bidirectional level translation with mixed voltage systems 


## Motor control

Washing Machine Motor Controller Washing machines usually employ a single-phase motor. In semi-automatic washing machines, a purely mechanical switch controls the timing and direction of the motor.There are different components connected to the microcontroller like triac,power which is used for drum.

### Traic


The Triac is most commonly used semiconductor device for switching and power control of AC systems as the triac can be switched “ON” by either a positive or negative Gate pulse, regardless of the polarity of the AC supply at that time.


## System Management

This disclosure relates to a washing machine control system for preventing or at least mitigating machine noise, vibration and/or other effects on machine operation during drum rotation at or close to drum resonant frequencies. where it is used for heating water,door lock,pumps,water value,

### Temperature sensor


A temperature sensor is an internal element of a washing machine, which is responsible for heating water to a certain temperature and turning off the heating element. And if at one fine moment, the machine heats the water too much or does not do it at all, then the cause of the breakdown may be in the temperature sensor.
