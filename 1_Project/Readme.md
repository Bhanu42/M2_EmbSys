# M2_EmbSys_Traffic-signal-system


The project is aimed at designing a density based dynamic traffic signal system where the timing of signal will change automatically on sensing the traffic density at any junction. Traffic congestion is a severe problem in most cities across the world and therefore it is time to shift more manual mode or fixed timer mode to an automated system with decision making capabilities. Present day traffic signaling system is fixed time based which may render inefficient if one lane is operational than the others. To optimize this problem we have made a framework for an intelligent traffic control system.
